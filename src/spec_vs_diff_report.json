  "summary": "Core Valentine single-page UI is added with romantic theme styling and a Yes-reveal view that displays the meme image via a static /assets/generated path. However, key acceptance-criteria details appear off (button labels and exact reveal message string), the required static image file itself is not present in the diff, and the diff includes changes under explicitly immutable paths (useInternetIdentity/useActor/main.tsx).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Page asks “Will you be my Valentine?” with two buttons labeled exactly “Yes” and “No”.",
      "reason": "The Yes button label shown in the diff is “Yes! 💖” rather than exactly “Yes”. The No button code is truncated so exact label cannot be verified from the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "On Yes click, show the exact message: “I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY YES AND CHOOSE ME ANYDAY OVER ANYONE”.",
      "reason": "The reveal message is split across two headings (“I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY YES” and “AND CHOOSE ME ANYDAY OVER ANYONE”), so the exact full sentence does not appear as a single exact string in the UI per the diff.",

      "requirement": "Add the generated image file under frontend/public/assets/generated with the exact filename valentine-meme.dim_1200x800.png.",
      "reason": "The UI references the image at /assets/generated/valentine-meme.dim_1200x800.png, but the diff does not show the actual static asset file being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
